This is a project that was created in under 2 hours, written by an developer inexprienced in javascript and advised by a more experienced javascript developer. The idea was to create a quick project for a micro-hackathon kind of competition. We went with a Reddit clone.

Build Instructions: 

* Install Node
* run `npm install` from the project root directory
* run `node server` from the project root directory
